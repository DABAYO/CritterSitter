**Why CritterSitter?** - Not all pet sitters are created equal, nor are they all professional.  In finding a pet sitter, it is important to make sure you have chosen the right person to care for your beloved animal.

Using a professional pet sitter reaps benefits for both pets and pet owners. Once you experience one of our listed pet care professionals, you'll never worry about being away from your pet again.

Benefits to your pets include:
* In some cases, staying at home in his/her safe, secure environment
* In some cases, being surrounded by familiar sights, smells and sounds
* Following his/her regular diet and exercise routine
* Having play time
* Receiving love and personal attention
* Maintaining medical treatment, when required
* Having someone responsible in case of an emergency
* Eliminating the trauma of travel or an unfamiliar environment
* Helping to ensure good health (no exposure to other animals' illness or parasites)

Benefits to you include:
* Knowing that your pet is in caring, loving hands
* Feeling secure with a sitter who trained, bonded and insured
* Having the confidence that the pet sitter can deal with other issues - such as emergencies and vet visits
* Not having to impose on family, friends or neighbors
